		<h3 class="">Data Scientist.</h3>

		<p>I'm a Data Science professional. I work mostly in Python and I really enjoy building end-to-end data products. Currently, I'm pursuing MS in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson and I have an bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I have a total of 4 years of work experience. I'm focused on helping clients to make intelligent and actionable decisions by modeling data-driven businesses through data science and machine learning. My skillset include translating complex business problems into data problems, solving them using state of the art techniques, and ultimately communicating the results to the stakeholders in their language.</p>

		<p> I enjoy outdoor activities. I'm an avid hiker and I see hiking as an opportunity to get closer to nature. I am interested in geopolitics and maps. I have a liking for films and books as well.</p>

		<p>That's about me. If you have anything you'd like to talk, please feel free to <a href="mailto:divakar.hebbar.2019@anderson.ucla.edu">mail me.</a></p>
